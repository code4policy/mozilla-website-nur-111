    <h1>What to do when your apartment heater stops working</h1>
    <p>Based on a true story as of January 8, 2026</p>
    <img src="firefox-icon.png" alt="A random fox picture" />
    <p>Sadly, this fox has nothing to do with staying warm in a cold unit</p>
    <p>But you can always follow the following tips: </p>

    <ul> 
        <li>stay in bed all day and skip J-term class (hypothetically speaking)</li>
        <li>alternatively, stay in the HKS building until 11 pm</li>
        <li>make coffee first thing in the morning to warm one's kitchen</li>
        <li>borrow my roommate's extra heater -- and inevitably trip the electric circuit</li>
